# Add your own custom alias in the custom/aliases directory. Aliases placed here
# will override ones with the same name in the main alias directory.
# 
# please note that you have to:
#
# 1. use the exact naming schema like '<my_aliases>.aliases.sh' where the
#    filename ending ~.aliases.sh is obligatory (just <my_aliases>.sh won't do)
# 2. add the leading part of that filename ('my_aliases' in this example) to
#    the 'aliases' array in your ~/.bashrc
